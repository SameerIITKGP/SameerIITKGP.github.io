Hello friends, This is my first blog. The reason to start this blog is that, I just wanted to organize my daily work for future reviews. So I thought why not start a blog.<br><br>
On reading about blogging I found that there are many more benefits of blogging. Some of them are <br>
1. To Express Your Thoughts and Opinions. You have something to say. You’ll have a platform to where you can say it and be heard.<br>
2. You’ll become a Better Writer. Writing is communication and is about expressing your thoughts on paper. Blogging wont force you, it’ll just happen as you do it.<br>
3. You’ll become a Better Thinker. Writing includes thinking and blogging processes encourages you to think even deeper. Better thinking will help you to develop an eye for meaningful things.<br>
4. You’ll Meet People Like You. It can be through comments, e-mails or social media, blogging will help you find those people whom you can share your opinions and thoughts.<br>
5. It’ll serve as a Personal Journal. This is a sufficient enough reason to start blogging. It trains our minds to track our life and feel the changes we are experiencing.<br><br>  

If you are still not convinced to start a blog, you can review these links or rather say my inspiration to start a blog ;)<br>
