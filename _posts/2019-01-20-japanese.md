### Konnichiwa, minasan!
<br>
Yes! I decided to learn Japanese :D
<br><br>
Japanese is regarded as one of the world's three most difficult languages to learn (For non-natives obviously, duh!). But I'm a HUGE manga and anime fan-boy, and why not get them neurons cracking, eh? ;)
<br>
I'm also a big fan of Japan and the Japanese culture. The way that nation has recovered and taken up responsibilities after Hiroshima & Nagasaki, inspires the shit out of me!
<br>

<br><br>
Okay, so here it is.
<br>
I've just started today from this amazing website - [Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/)
<br>
Basically there are 3 syllabaries in the Japanese language: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.
<br>
Hiragana and Katakana (collectively referred to as "kana") are fairly simple to grasp and memorize, Kanji being much much more complex. Kanji is the ancient characters adopted from the Chinese Hanzhi writing. They each convey an idea, and are used for nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. This collection of more than 7,000 characters usually has double meanings for each one, depending on the context and position in the sentence. x_x
<br><br>
So I've obviously planned to move from Hiragana -> Katakana -> Kanji,
<br>
and Pronunciation -> Reading -> Typing -> {Writing}
<br>
No one really writes anything now-a-days (except your own signature), and writing Japanese is really difficult for a beginner. So, I'll leave that for the end, if Time and Tempo permits.
<br><br>
PS: This is not a class. So, I don't have to move at the pace of the slowest 10%. There is NO Speed Limit!
I can learn the entire Hiragana alphabet in one day if I wish it, and that makes me kinda Happy :)
<br>
I'm writing this blog post to inspire more people to learn this amazing language, and also as a personal journel to track my progress :)
