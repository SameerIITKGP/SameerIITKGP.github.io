### Happiness is a Choice!
<br><br>
One of the saddest truth about life is that "People will always be unhappy with what they have, and will always crave for what they don't have."
<br><br>
This is no way means that one should not be ambitious. You should fight/struggle for the things you want.
<br>
But Happiness is independant of all this jargon.
<br>
Whatever you are trying to do or achieve in your life, if you think deeply, IT IS for Happiness!
<br>
Wouldn't things make more sense if you be happy and then do things :)
<br><br>
If you are unconditionally happy, all the pain and suffering in this world can't even touch you!
<br><br>
Now go! And be Happy for Life! :D

Love and Regards,<br>
