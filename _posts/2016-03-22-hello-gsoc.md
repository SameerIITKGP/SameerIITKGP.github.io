I am applying for Google Summer of Code, 2016.<br>
It is an annual program sponsored by Google, that pays students to contribute to open source organizations of their choice. My application involves creating a backend API and a multimedia frontend reading interface for reading and serious study of Classical Languages. You can read more about the project at the [GSoC-Ideas](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/Project-ideas) page of CLTK.<br>
You can read more about Classical Languages and CLTK [here](http://cltk.org/)<br><br>
I will use this blog to write about my GSoC experience, if I am selected.<br><br>
Regards,<br>
Sameer
