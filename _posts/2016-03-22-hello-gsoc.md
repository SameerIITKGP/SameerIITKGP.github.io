I am applying for Google Summer of Code, 2016.<br>
It is an annual program sponsored by Google, that pays students to contribute to open source organizations of their choice. You can read more about the program [here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)<br><br>
I will use this blog to write about my GSoC experience, if I am selected.<br><br>
Regards,<br>
Sameer
