To the hypocrite within me and you,
### "If you don't walk the walk, It's probably best not to talk the talk."
My first blog post came in August, 2017. Ironically, it focussed on the importance of regular blogging! I was moved by this quote and decided to end this cycle of hypocricy. So here I am :)<br><br>
The problem with quotes is they give you a blast of motivation, but it is really short lived. Only motivation won't take you anywhere. It's when the motivation turns into a Habit, you start to blossom.<br>
That's when you learn the Art of Self-motivation.<br><br>
This post accomodates numerous quotes and short stories, for when I feel low or I need a boost for some mammoth task. I'll try my best to keep adding more and more ...<br>
Don't let it stop from helping you too! :)<br><br>

"To live and let live, without clamor for distinction or recognition,<br>
to write truth first on the tablet of one's own heart<br>
This is the sanity and perfection of living."
<br><br></font>

Within all of us there is a battle of two wolves.<br>
One is evil. He is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.<br>
The other is good. He is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.<br>

"Either you run the day, or the day runs you."

"Two things define you: Your patience when you have nothing,<br>
and your attitude when you have everything."

Waqt ki qaid mein zindagi hai magar<br>
Chand ghadiyan yehi hain jo aazad hain
<br><br></font>
<font size="4">
Apna zamana aap banate hain ahl-e-dil<br>
Hum vo nahin ki jin ko zamana bana gaya
<br><br></font>
<font size="4">
Abhi se paanv ke chhaale na dekho<br>
abhi yaaro safar ki ibtida hai
<br><br></font>
<font size="4">
Saahil ke sukoon se kise inkaar hai lekin<br>
Toofaan se ladne mein maza hi kuch aur hai
<br><br></font>
<font size="4">
Har roz gir kar bhi, mukammmal khade hain<br>
Ae zindagi dekh, mere honsle tujhse bhi bade hain
<br><br></font>
<br>
Love and Regards,<br>
Sameer
