To the hypocrite within me and you,
### "If you don't walk the walk, It's probably best not to talk the talk."
My first blog post came in August, 2017. Ironically, it focussed on the importance of regular blogging! I was moved by this quote and decided to end this cycle of hypocracy. So here I am :)<br><br>
The problem with quotes is they give you a blast of motivation, but it is really short lived. Only motivation won't take you anywhere. It's when the motivation turns into a Habit, you start to blossom.<br>
That's when you learn the Art of Self-motivation.<br><br>
This post accomodates numerous quotes and short stories, for when I feel low or I need a boost for some mammoth task. I'll try my best to keep adding more and more ...<br>
Don't let it stop from helping you too! :)<br><br>
### "Look fear in the face and it will cease to trouble you."

### "To live and let live, without clamor for distinction or recognition; to write truth first on the tablet of one's own heart - this is the sanity and perfection of living."
<!-- <br><br> -->
### Within all of us there is a battle of two wolves. One is evil. He is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other is good. He is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. "The one you feed grows stronger!"

### "Quitting smoking can be a very good test of ones character. Pass the test and you will have accomplished so much more than just get rid of one bad habit."
<!-- <br><br> -->
### "Either you run the day, or the day runs you."
<!-- <br><br> -->
### "Two things define you: Your patience when you have nothing and your attitude when you have everything."
<!-- <br><br> -->
