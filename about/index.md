I am a Third year Undergraduate of the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, IIT Kharagpur.<br>
I am passionate about software development and open-source.<br>
I am very much interested in the latest Technology, specially on the IOT front.<br>
I'm also enthusiastic about Machine Learning and Data Analysis.<br>
I have proficient programming skills in C, Python and Java.<br>
I like Python because it easily lets me convert my ideas into code.
